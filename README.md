# DS_Capstone_Project

The main focus of this project is health insurance coverage in the United States. Specifically, we explore various factors that might influence the uninsured rate, and the potential impact of lacking health insurance coverage on peopleâ€™s health condition. Our data is mainly from two sources: American Community Survey and the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, a program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. This project is completed in Shiny App because we want our audience to directly manipulate the graphs and regressions based on their interests. The project can be separated into two parts: data visualization and regression analysis. The Data visualization is displayed in tab 1 and 3, including a list of interactive plots, county-level and state-level U.S. maps. The regression Analysis is stored in tab 2. All the dataset and source code can be downloaded from the Github page().

We acknowledge that there are many problems embedded in this project. We would like to explore more on the data visualization part in the future, specifically to increase the interactivity of the maps. We also want to refine the overall design of the app.
